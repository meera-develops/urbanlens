# 🌆 Urban Lens

## 📌 Project Overview

Urban Lens is a web application that allows users to explore, compare, and understand the cost of living across different cities. The project presents city-level data in a clear, visual, and accessible way to help users make informed decisions about where they might want to live, work, or travel.

Users can browse cities, view detailed cost-of-living breakdowns, and compare cities side-by-side to see how they stack up across key metrics.

- Apply real-world software development workflows (planning, collaboration, version control)
- Build a scalable and maintainable full-stack application
- Practice accessibility-first and user-centered design
- Gain experience deploying and hosting a production-ready application
